# Reuven Lerner, Python trainer

Hi there! I'm Reuven, and I've been using Python fo rmore than 30 years. 

I've been in business since 1995, teaching Python, Pandas, and Git to people around the world — via in-person corporate training, and also via my [LernerPython](https://LernerPython.com) online platform, where you get courses, exercises, office hours, members-only lectures, and a Discord forum to ask questions.

Wondering if [LernerPython](https://LernerPython.com) is for you? Here's what some people have said:

> The depth and breadth of the educational materials in a LernerPython membership is unmatched anywhere I've found. But what really makes this standout is the way Reuven teaches the material. He takes complicated subjects and makes them simple. You don't have to go much beyond his PyCon 2024 tutorial on decorators or his class on comprehensions to see this. There is a TON of fantastic material in a LernerPython subscription and more is always being added to it. It is one of my favorite and most valuable sources of Python educational materials. — *Michael Dahlberg, Systems Administrator*

> If you find yourself just trying to get things to work but still wondering why it does, you will find value in it. You will find yourself going back to the videos over and over again to deepen your understanding. There are office hours and webinars where you can ask questions and get in-depth responses which help strengthen your foundation. Reuven also brings a lot of (funny) anecdotes from experience as well as many other resources (libraries, useful links, packages) that really help accelerate your fluency in the language. - *Ahmed, Sr Infrastructure Engineer*

Every week, I publish several newsletters:

- [Better Developers](https://BetterDevelopersWeekly.com), with practical tips, tricks, and articles about Python
- [Bamboo Weekly](https://BambooWeekly.com), deep-dive, hard-core data-analysis puzzles based on current events and real-world data sets
- [Trainer Weekly](https://TrainerWeekly.com), where I talk about the pedagogy, logistcs, and business of training

I have a large library of YouTube videos about Python and Pandas at https://YouTube.com/reuvenlerner .

I've published two books of exercises, to help you improve your skills:

- [Python Workout](https://PythonWorkout.com), with 200+ exercises to improve your Python fluency
- [Pandas Workout](https://PandasWorkout.com), with 200+ exercises to improve your Pandas fluency
