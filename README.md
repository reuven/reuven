# Reuven Lerner, Python trainer

Hi there! I'm Reuven, and I've been using Python fo rmore than 30 years. 

I've been in business since 1995, teaching Python, Pandas, and Git to people around the world — via in-person corporate training, and also via my [LernerPython](https://LernerPython.com) online platform, where you get courses, exercises, office hours, members-only lectures, and a Discord forum to ask questions.

> The depth and breadth of the educational materials in a LernerPython membership is unmatched anywhere I've found. But what really makes this standout is the way Reuven teaches the material. He takes complicated subjects and makes them simple. You don't have to go much beyond his PyCon 2024 tutorial on decorators or his class on comprehensions to see this. There is a TON of fantastic material in a LernerPython subscription and more is always being added to it. It is one of my favorite and most valuable sources of Python educational materials. — *Michael Dahlberg, Systems Administrator*
