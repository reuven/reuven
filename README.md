# Reuven Lerner, Python trainer

Hi there, and welcome to my GitHub repos!  Most days, I am teaching Python and data science to people at companies around the world. In 2019 (pre-coronavirus), I taught in the US, UK, Europe, Israel, India, and China. Nowadays, I still teach people around the world, but from the comfort of my home office.

You can learn more about my corporate training options at https://lerner.co.il/courses .  

I also offer many online courses. You can read about those at https://store.lerner.co.il/. I'm particularly proud of (https://WeeklyPythonExercise.com)[Weekly Python Exercise], a set of courses that help people to improve their Python fluency through exercises and community discussion.

I also wrote (https://PythonWorkout.comn/)["Python Workout"] for Manning, loaded with exercises to make you a more fluent Python developer.

I've been self-employed since 1995 (!), and help others to succeed with their own businesses on the (https://businessoffreelancing.com/)[Business of Freelancing] podcast.

This repo contains some open-source software, and many Jupyter notebooks from conference and Meetup talks I've given.

Please contact me if you have questions!
