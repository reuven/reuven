# Reuven Lerner, Python trainer

Hi there! I'm Reuven, and I've been using Python fo rmore than 30 years. 

I've been in business since 1995, teaching Python, Pandas, and Git to people around the world — via in-person corporate training, and also via my [LernerPython](https://LernerPython.com) online platform, where you get courses, exercises, office hours, members-only lectures, and a Discord forum to ask questions.

Every week, I publish several newsletters:

- [Better Developers](https://BetterDevelopersWeekly.com), with practical tips, tricks, and articles about Python
- [Bamboo Weekly](https://BambooWeekly.com), deep-dive, hard-core data-analysis puzzles based on current events and real-world data sets
- [Trainer Weekly](https://TrainerWeekly.com), where I talk about the pedagogy, logistcs, and business of training

I have a large library of YouTube videos about Python and Pandas at https://YouTube.com/reuvenlerner .

I've published two books of exercises, to help you improve your skills:

- [Python Workout](https://PythonWorkout.com), with 200+ exercises to improve your Python fluency
- [Pandas Workout](https://PandasWorkout.com), with 200+ exercises to improve your Pandas fluency
