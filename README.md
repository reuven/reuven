# Want to improve your Python and Pandas skills?

Welcome! I'm Reuven, and I teach Python and Pandas for a living, training engineers at companies such as Apple, Arm, Cisco, Intel, Sandisk, and VMWare in these technologies.

## LernerPython

You can get my courses, as well as exercises, projects, office hours, members-only lectures, and a Discord forum via my [LernerPython](https://LernerPython.com) online platform. My goal is to help you become more fluent and confident using Python and Pandas.

Wondering if [LernerPython](https://LernerPython.com) is for you? Here's what some people have said:

> The depth and breadth of the educational materials in a LernerPython membership is unmatched anywhere I've found. But what really makes this standout is the way Reuven teaches the material. He takes complicated subjects and makes them simple. You don't have to go much beyond his PyCon 2024 tutorial on decorators or his class on comprehensions to see this. There is a TON of fantastic material in a LernerPython subscription and more is always being added to it. It is one of my favorite and most valuable sources of Python educational materials. — *Michael Dahlberg, Systems Administrator*

> If you find yourself just trying to get things to work but still wondering why it does, you will find value in it. You will find yourself going back to the videos over and over again to deepen your understanding. There are office hours and webinars where you can ask questions and get in-depth responses which help strengthen your foundation. Reuven also brings a lot of (funny) anecdotes from experience as well as many other resources (libraries, useful links, packages) that really help accelerate your fluency in the language. - *Ahmed, Sr Infrastructure Engineer*
